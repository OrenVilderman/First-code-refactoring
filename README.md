This project is the result of self  study.
=============
Created by [Oren Vilderman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oren-vilderman-5208a8171/)<br/>
> The purpose of this project is to start a talk about refactoring and a cleaner code writing as I progress in Automated testing.

**In this project I am using only cssSelectors to catch the different WebElements,**<br/>**For example : "attribute='value'" and ".classname".**<br/><br/>
**The project is a program that login to an existing GMail account, composes emails in a loop and then delete them**

The code is written in a readable way and the program itself is an older program I wrote few months ago,<br/>
This process of "polishing" older versions of the code into a newer code, that fulfill exactly the same functions is an ongoing process that is called refactoring,<br/>
This is what this project is about.
